- random variable:
	- quantity whose possible value depend, in some clearly-defined way, on a set of random events.
- probability distribution:
	- theoretical model depicting the possible values a random variable may assume along with the probability of occurance.
- How to state your hypothesis:
	- null hypothesis
	- alternate hypothesis
	- significant level (Î±) - often 5% 
	- P-value 
		- is the probability that a random chance generate data , or something else that is equal to or rarer.
		- the likelihood of observing that particular sample value if the null hypothesis were true. if p value is less than significant level we reject null hypothesis.otherwise we FAIL TO REJECT the null hypothesis.
- normal distribution
	- depends on variable , mean and standard deviation.

	- standard normal
		- if mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1
