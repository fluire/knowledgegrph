[[statistics]]

# Central tendency
- Mean : 
	- for continuous variables
	- affected by outliers
	- sum of distances of observation to mean is zero
- Median :
	- Unique 
	- not affected by outliers
	- used for ratio, interval and ordinal data
- Mode :
	- most frequent occurring values

# Dispersion

- degree of variation in data
- Range : difference b/w min and max
1. variance:
	-  population : 
		- sigma^2 = summation(diff(observation - mean)^2) / total number of observations
	- sample : 
		- s^2 = summation(diff(observation - mean)^2) / total number of observations-1)
2. Standard deviation:
	- sqroot of variance
