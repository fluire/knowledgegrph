- ## modeling overview
	- Data centric and model centric ai training
	- # AI = CODE + DATA
	- ## challenges in model development
		- Doing well on training set.
		- doing well on test set.
		- doing well on business metrics / project goals.
		- Rare classes
	*few points to ponder
		- explicitly providing weight to the certain example to get desired results is not a good practice.
	- establishing baseline:
		- like HLP -> human level performance (unstructured data)
		- literature search for state of the art
		- quick and dirty implementation
		- performance of older system.
		- *ask for time to establish baseline*
	- **A REASONALBLE ALGORITHM WITH GOOD DATA WILL OFTEN OUTPERFORM A GREAT ALGORITHM WITH NOT SOGOOD DATA**
	- deployment constraints when picking a model:
		- Yes consider is base line is established.
		- no, if purpose is to establish a baseline and determine what is possible and might worth pursuing.
	- sanity check -> try to overfit one example before training on large dataset. 
	- to check the error analysis and  [[error analysis and performance auditing]]
