- Previous week
	- tokenizer -> OOV word handling
	- sequence generator
	- padding
- Word embeddings
	- exercise through imdb review
		- loading data using tensorflowdatasets -> dividing to train and test -> with two sets of data in each namely sentences and label.
		- ![[Pasted image 20221005170814.png]]
		- then doing the process done in previous week 
		- ![[Pasted image 20221005170904.png]]
		- define neural net:
			- we use embedding layer in the begning.
			- ![[Pasted image 20221005171147.png]]
			- model.compile...
			- model.fit()
		- how to get the embeddings layer weights
			- ![[Pasted image 20221005172451.png]]
			- reversewordindex = token.wordindex()
			- ![[Pasted image 20221005172616.png]]
