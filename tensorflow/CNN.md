- link to on how to the filters work on images :
	- [https://github.com/https-deeplearning-ai/tensorflow-1-public/blob/main/C1/W3/ungraded_labs/C1_W3_Lab_2_exploring_convolutions.ipynb]()
	- convolution is a filter running on the image pixel and performing operation using the two
	- pooling filter not only reduces the image size but also emphasize the feature helpful in feature extraction.

- use sigmoid for binary classification and softmax for multiclass
